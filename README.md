# React Native Weather Forecast
Weather forecast application for mobile android devices. Fetches weather report for the current day from **OpenWeatherMap** public API.
Developed with the use of React Native and Android Studio.

### Todo
  * Setting current geolocation as the city,
  * Replacing icons to more appropriate ones,
  * Adding support for data of 'probability of precipitation',
  * Adding support for all weather cases (e.g., current version does not correctly displays such cases as 'Snowing' or 'Fog').
  * Code refactoring
